### Project Requirements

The requirements of this project were tracked using Gitlab Issues. [Click here](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/c2008927/e2s_project_team_1/-/boards) to go to our issue board.

### Important Assumptions

The client was unable to provide live examples of pieces of equipment/infrastructure producing usage readings. To model this, we created a script in Python that automatically saves mocked readings to the database.

You can learn more about how we do this [here](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/c2008927/e2s_project_team_1/-/wikis/Mocking-Data-using-Lambda).
